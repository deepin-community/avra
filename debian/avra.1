.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAVRA\fR is an assembler for Atmel AVR microcontrollers, and it is almost
compatible with Atmel's own assembler AVRASM32.  The differences between the
two are:
.IP "Support for some extra preprocessor directives."
includes: .define, .undef, .ifdef, .ifndef, .if, .else, .endif, .elif, .elseif, .warning
.IP "Not all command line options are supported."
Specifying an eeprom file (\-e) is not supported. All eeprom data is
put out into a file called program.eep.hex and always Intel hex
format. Other hex file formats than Intel are currently not supported.
.IP "Forward references are not supported."
Like in C, you have to define everything before you are using it,
excepting labels. This makes sure, that directives like .ifdef and .undef
are working properly. If you are familiar with the C programming
language, you should get easily into \fBAVRA\fR. See chapter "Programming
techniques" for more information about how to write proper code.
.IP "Enhanced macro support."
\fBAVRA\fR has some new features for writing flexible macros. This should
increase the ability to reuse code e.g. build your own library.
.IP "Debugging support."
\fBAVRA\fR creates a coff file everytime the assembly was sucessful. This
file allows AVR Studio or any coff compatible debugger to simulate
or emulate the program.
.IP "Meta tags for assembly time."
This helps you tracking versions of your software and can also be
used to generate customer specific serial numbers.
